\begin{abstract}
We used a complex network approach to study the evolution of a large software system, 
Eclipse, with the aim of statistically characterize software defectiveness along the time.
We studied the software networks associated to several releases of the system, 
focusing our attention specifically on their community structure, modularity and clustering coefficient. 
% of more than 600 Java software networks, with
% the aim of characterizing the relationship among defectiveness and community metrics.
% We found that the software systems with highest modularity possess the majority of bugs, and 
% tested whether this result is related to some confounding effect.
We found that the maximum average defect density is related to two different metrics: 
the number of detected communities inside a software network
and the clustering coefficient. 
These two relationships both follow a power-law distribution which leads to a linear correlation 
between clustering coefficient and number of communities.
These results can be useful to make predictions about the evolution of software systems, 
especially with respect to their defectiveness.
% Our results can be used to make predictive hypotheses about software defectiveness of future releases of the analyzed systems.

% \subsection{Citations In Text}
% 
% Citations within the text should indicate the author's last name and
% year\cite{Knuth-vol3}. Reference style\cite{Comer-btree}
% should follow the style that you are used to using, as long as the
% citation style is consistent.
% 
% \subsubsection{Footnotes}
% 
% Indicate footnotes with a number\footnote{This is a sample footnote} in
% the text. Place the footnotes at the bottom of the page they appear on.
% Precede the footnote with a vertical rule of 2 inches (12 picas).
% 
% \subsubsection{Figures}
% 
% All artwork must be centered, neat, clean and legible. Do not use pencil
% or hand-drawn artwork. Figure number and caption always appear after the
% the figure. Place one line space before the figure, one line space
% before the figure caption and one line space after the figure caption.
% The figure caption is initial caps and each figure is numbered
% consecutively.
% 
% Make sure that the figure caption does not get separated from the
% figure. Leave extra white space at the bottom of the page to avoid
% splitting the figure and figure caption.
% 
% Figure \ref{fig1} shows how to include a figure as encapsulated postscript.
