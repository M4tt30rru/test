% \subsection{Defect Density Prediction}
Figures \ref{fig:abn.vs.n.comm} and \ref{fig:cc.vs.n.comm} show the distributions of the average bugs number 
(ABN, Fig. \ref{fig:abn.vs.n.comm}) 
and of clustering coefficient (CC, Fig. \ref{fig:cc.vs.n.comm}) with respect to the number of communities (NOC) 
for all the sub-projects of all the releases. 
Although the scatterplots for the relationship between NOC % number of communities 
and other metrics are sparse, the reported scatterplots show the existence
of a power-law-like relationship between the maximum values of the mentioned metrics. 
This led us to hypothesize a linear relationship between the maximum values of 
CC and the ABN. % average bug number. If this is the case the CC can be used to predict the maximum ABN % average number of defects 
% in a future release, 
% having cumulated the data belonging to the previous releases.
In Tab. \ref{tab:log-log-cc}, on the left, the power law exponents, 
the correlation coefficient, the $\chi^2$ and the degrees of freedom (\textit{dof}) for the best fitting in log-log scale are reported. 
They refer to different ``cumulated''
releases for the relationship between CC and NOC. % clustering coefficient and the number of communities. 
Table \ref{tab:log-log-cc} shows how the power laws parameters do not change significantly from one cumulated release to another. 
This suggests the existence of a progressively more stable behaviour during 
software evolution, where the fitting with a power law becomes 
more accurate and tends to a fixed value as new releases are added 
in the cumulated dataset.
The same considerations can be applied to the relationship between maximum ABN 
and NOC. % average bugs number and number of communities.
% stabilize around a fixed value
% Namely, with the addition of more releases, .
The scatterplot portraied in Fig. 2 % \ref{cumulated_bug_cc_EC} 
shows the relationship between the maximum defect density versus the maximum clustering coefficient, 
for all the cumulated releases, along with the best fitting straight line.
We investigated if, starting with a dataset of $N$ releases, the best fitting curve for the cumulated $N -1$ releases 
could also be a good fit for the $Nth$ release.
In order to measure the forecast accuracy we adopted a $\chi^2$ test.
Table \ref{tab:max_abn-vs-maxcc} reports the results of the best fitting for the relationship between CC and ABN showing that the linear correlation is not very high. Nonetheless, the $\chi^2$ test returns an high level of significance.
Table 2 % \ref{prevision_test} 
reports the results of the analysis on the forecast for software quality. 
We computed the ratio between the $\chi^2$ and the degrees of freedom. 
% The reported $\chi^2$ values are close to 1, meaning that for the given degrees of freedom the fits are good.
According to the results reported on Table \ref{tab:log-log-cc}, on the right, the 
$\chi^2$ values are close to 1, meaning that for the given degrees of 
freedom the fits are good.

% \subsection{Linear Correlations}
% \textbf{We also consider the relationship between maximum values of the defect density and the clustering coefficient. 
% From what emerged from the previous analysis both the distributions of the relationship between these two metrics and the number of communities follow a power law, so 
% we investigated the existence of a linear correlation among them.}
% Since the maximum values of the defect density and the maximum values of the clustering coefficient depend on the same variable (the number of communities) through a power law, we 
% decided to check the existence of a direct correlation among these two metrics.
% The scatterplot shown on Fig. \ref{cumulated_bug_cc_EC} shows the relationship between the maximum defect density versus the maximum clustering coefficient, 
% which has been fitted with a straight line. Tabs. \ref{tab:max_abn-vs-maxcc-EC} reports the values of Correlation coefficient, $\chi^2$, and degrees of freedom (dof)
% for Eclipse and NetBeans respectively.
% 
% To verify this hypothesis we used as training set all the releases except the last one. 
% 
% In order to measure the prediction accuracy, we performed a  $\chi^2$ test
% to understand whether the points of the last release (the data sample) could be fitted by the best fitting curve of the points from 
% all the previous releases. 
% The quality of this prediction is thus given by the normalized $\chi^2$, which provides the goodness of the fit.
% The fits have been performed for the maximum defect density versus number of communities, and for the maximum clustering coefficient versus number of
% communities.
% 
% \textbf{As can been seen by looking at Tab. \ref{tab:log-log-cc-NB}}, the parameters of the power laws do not change significantly from one release to another, 
% indicating a stable behaviour during software evolution in the analysed projects. 
% Namely, with the addition of more releases, the fitting with a power law becomes more accurate, and tends to 
% stabilize around a fixed value.
% % This observation can be used to predict the maximum number of defects in every set of sub-projects having the same 
% % number of communities in the next release, from the measurements of previous releases. 
% % To verify this hypothesis we used as training set all the releases except the last one.
% \textbf{The value reported on Table \ref{prevision_test} shows that $\chi^2$ values are close to 1, meaning that for the given degrees of freedom the fits are good.}
% on Fig. \ref{cumulated_bug_cc_EC} we see ... Even if the linear correlation coefficient is not very high, the $\chi^2$ provides a high significance level, suggesting that each variable is a good predictor 
% of the other one. This indicates that if the maximum values of the clustering coefficient are known for the various number of communities,
% one can in principle estimate the maximum density of defects for that number of communities.
