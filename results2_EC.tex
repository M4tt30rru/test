% \subsection{Defect Density Prediction}
The Figg. \ref{fig:abn.vs.n.comm} and \ref{fig:cc.vs.n.comm} show the distributions of the average bugs number 
(ABN, Fig. \ref{fig:abn.vs.n.comm}) 
and clustering coefficient (CC, Fig. \ref{fig:cc.vs.n.comm}) with respect to the number of communities (NOC) 
for all the sub-projects of all the releases. 
Whereas the scatterplots for the relationship between NOC 
and other metrics are sparse, the reported scatterplots show that 
there is a power-law-like relationship between the maximum values of the mentioned metrics. 
This led us to hypothesize that there is a linear relationship between the maximum values of CC and the ABN. 
If this was the case, then the CC could be used to predict the maximum ABN s 
in a future release, given the cumulated data from the past.
In Tab. \ref{tab:log-log-cc-NB} 
the power law exponents, the correlation coefficient $r$, the $\chi^2$
and the degrees of freedom (\textit{dof})for the best fitting in log-log scale are reported. 
The latter refer to  the relationship between CC and NOC for different ``cumulated''
releases.
As can been seen by looking at Tab. \ref{tab:log-log-cc}, power laws parameters do not change significantly 
from one cumulated release to another. This seems to suggest that there is a stable behaviour during 
software evolution, when the fitting with a power law becomes more accurate and tends to a fixed value 
as new releases are added in the cumulated dataset.
Same behaviour applies for the relationship between maximum ABN and NOC, as shown in Tab.~\ref{tab:log-log-max-abn-vs-noc}. 

The scatterplot shown on Fig. \ref{cumulated_bug_cc} shows the relationship between the maximum defect 
density versus the maximum clustering coefficient, 
for all the cumulated releases, along with the fitting straight line.
The plot shows a stable behaviour during the evolution the Eclipse project, so it can be used to make predictions about 
the quality of future releases in relation with their topology.
Starting with a dataset of $N$ releases, we investigated if the best fitting curve for the cumulated $N -1$ releases 
could be also a good fit for the $Nth$ releases.

As a measure of prevision accuracy, we adopted a $\chi^2$ test.
In Table 4 we can see the results of the fitting for the relationship between CC and ABN where we can see that 
linear correlation is not high. Nonetheless, $\chi^2$ returns an high significance level.
Table 2 % \ref{prevision_test} 
reports the results of the analysis on the prediction quality. 
We computed the ratio between $\chi^2$ and the degree of freedom. 
% The reported $\chi^2$ values are close to 1, meaning that for the given degrees of freedom the fits are good.
As it can be seen from the values reported on Table \ref{prevision_test}, $\chi^2$ values are close to 1, 
meaning that for the given degrees of freedom the fits are good.
